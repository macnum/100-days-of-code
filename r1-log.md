# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [macnum]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [July 10, Saturday, 2025].

## Log

### R1D1 
Restarted my coding journey today!
Watched a 1.5-hour YouTube video on CSS and learned about: Columns, Flexbox, Positioning, A bit about working with imagesand  i'm excited to keep going! 💪

### R1D2 ✅
Learned a bit about TDD (Test-Driven Development) today.
Still getting familiar with the concept, but it's a start!

### R1D3 ✅
Learned about event delegation and event bubbling in JavaScript.
Continued exploring Test-Driven Development (TDD).
Making steady progress!

### R1D4 ✅
Built a simple shopping list that lets you add and delete items using events and DOM manipulation.
Started working on a graphic interface for The Odin Project's Rock Paper Scissors game 🎮

### R1D5
Didn’t do much today, just completed the Rock Paper Scissors game.
Planning to make up for it with more focused work tomorrow! 

### R1D6
Completed The Odin Project’s Etch-a-Sketch project today!
Practiced DOM manipulation, event listeners, and added hover effects with different color modes.

### R1D7
Light day today. Revisited array methods and brushed up on higher-order array functions like .map(), .filter(), and .reduce(). Also started getting familiar with JavaScript objects.


### R1D8
Studied JavaScript objects today. Didn’t get a lot done, but made some progress with understanding how objects work, constructor.


### R1D9
Revisited high-order array methods and objects. Practiced with exercises using filter, sort, map, reduce, some, every, and find. Also explored how to access and work with arrays of objects.

### R1D10
Day 10
Completed JavaScript exercises including palindrome checks, Fibonacci sequence, and more. Read blog posts on Regular Expressions to deepen understanding.
- Lows: Supposed to move on to the calculator project, but struggling to visualize how to approach it. Feeling a bit of “code feet,” but planning to start it tomorrow regardless.

- Highs: Made it to Day 10 of the challenge — a solid milestone! 90 more days to go 💪

### R1D11
Started working on the calculator project from The Odin Project.

 - Lows: Struggling to figure out the logic for selecting buttons and adding their values. It’s frustrating not being able to connect the pieces yet.

 - Highs: Still showed up and gave it a shot — that’s what counts. Progress over perfection.

### R1D12
Took a step back today. Watched Brad Traversy’s Modern JavaScript course on Udemy to reset. Been stuck on The Odin Project's calculator—frustrating but stepping back helps. Ready to dive back in tomorrow! Progress is progress.

### R1D13
Day 13 of #100DaysOfCode
I’m honestly exhausted today. I’ve tried multiple approaches for the calculator project — rewritten the code more than 8 times. I even experimented with using objects since they are reference types, thinking it would make assigning variables easier, but the logic still isn’t clicking. The app behavior is all over the place.

On the bright side, I’m now trying to apply the principle of separation of concerns — breaking the project into smaller, focused functions for each task. Hopefully, that brings some structure and clarity.

Lows: Feeling frustrated. The more I try, the more the bugs pile up. It’s been hard figuring out the right flow.

Highs: Still showing up and pushing through. Trying to write cleaner code by organizing logic into separate functions. That’s growth in itself.

### R1D14 
Day 14 of #100DaysOfCode

Missed yesterday’s commit (fell asleep :sweat_smile:), so here’s the update:

:tada: Got the basic calculator working!

Current issue: The operate function runs multiple times when clicking "=" or operator buttons. Working on fixing the logic to ensure it runs only once unless a new value is added.

Lows: Debugging this is exhausting.

Highs: The calculator actually works now!

### R1D15
Missed a commit yesterday—wedding party vibes 🎉.
Exhausted, so not much coding done, but I stayed in the learning zone:
📺 Watched WebBos videos on Emmet
📘 Read Emmet docs
📰 Browsed dev articles

### R1D16
✅ Finished my Calculator Project! It might still be a little buggy, but I’m calling it done for now — I can always come back to fine-tune it later.
🧠 Also spent time learning and practicing:

- Emmet — makes writing HTML/CSS so much faster.
- SVG — explored how scalable vector graphics work and how to use them.
Highs: Big win getting the calculator project across the finish line!
Lows: Still a few quirks in the code

### R1D17
Forgot to commit yesterday. Eyes have been feeling tired for no reason lately. 😓
Kept it light — explored HTML tables. Surprising how deep and broad the topic is!

### R1D18
Forgot to commit again yesterday—been so tired lately by evening 😴
Did an exercise on HTML tables. Learned about scope, id, headers, col, row, rowgroup, colgroup.
Also explored CSS resets: Normalize, Meyer’s Reset, and others.
