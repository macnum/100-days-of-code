# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [macnum]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [July 10, Saturday, 2025].

## Log

### R1D1 
Restarted my coding journey today!
Watched a 1.5-hour YouTube video on CSS and learned about: Columns, Flexbox, Positioning, A bit about working with imagesand  i'm excited to keep going! 💪

### R1D2 ✅
Learned a bit about TDD (Test-Driven Development) today.
Still getting familiar with the concept, but it's a start!

### R1D3 ✅
Learned about event delegation and event bubbling in JavaScript.
Continued exploring Test-Driven Development (TDD).
Making steady progress!

### R1D4 ✅
Built a simple shopping list that lets you add and delete items using events and DOM manipulation.
Started working on a graphic interface for The Odin Project's Rock Paper Scissors game 🎮

### R1D5
Didn’t do much today, just completed the Rock Paper Scissors game.
Planning to make up for it with more focused work tomorrow! 

### R1D6
Completed The Odin Project’s Etch-a-Sketch project today!
Practiced DOM manipulation, event listeners, and added hover effects with different color modes.

### R1D7
Light day today. Revisited array methods and brushed up on higher-order array functions like .map(), .filter(), and .reduce(). Also started getting familiar with JavaScript objects.


### R1D8
Studied JavaScript objects today. Didn’t get a lot done, but made some progress with understanding how objects work, constructor.


### R1D9
Revisited high-order array methods and objects. Practiced with exercises using filter, sort, map, reduce, some, every, and find. Also explored how to access and work with arrays of objects.

### R1D10
Day 10
Completed JavaScript exercises including palindrome checks, Fibonacci sequence, and more. Read blog posts on Regular Expressions to deepen understanding.
- Lows: Supposed to move on to the calculator project, but struggling to visualize how to approach it. Feeling a bit of “code feet,” but planning to start it tomorrow regardless.

- Highs: Made it to Day 10 of the challenge — a solid milestone! 90 more days to go 💪

### R1D11
Started working on the calculator project from The Odin Project.

 - Lows: Struggling to figure out the logic for selecting buttons and adding their values. It’s frustrating not being able to connect the pieces yet.

 - Highs: Still showed up and gave it a shot — that’s what counts. Progress over perfection.

### R1D12
Took a step back today. Watched Brad Traversy’s Modern JavaScript course on Udemy to reset. Been stuck on The Odin Project's calculator—frustrating but stepping back helps. Ready to dive back in tomorrow! Progress is progress.

### R1D13
Day 13 of #100DaysOfCode
I’m honestly exhausted today. I’ve tried multiple approaches for the calculator project — rewritten the code more than 8 times. I even experimented with using objects since they are reference types, thinking it would make assigning variables easier, but the logic still isn’t clicking. The app behavior is all over the place.

On the bright side, I’m now trying to apply the principle of separation of concerns — breaking the project into smaller, focused functions for each task. Hopefully, that brings some structure and clarity.

Lows: Feeling frustrated. The more I try, the more the bugs pile up. It’s been hard figuring out the right flow.

Highs: Still showing up and pushing through. Trying to write cleaner code by organizing logic into separate functions. That’s growth in itself.

### R1D14 
Day 14 of #100DaysOfCode

Missed yesterday’s commit (fell asleep :sweat_smile:), so here’s the update:

:tada: Got the basic calculator working!

Current issue: The operate function runs multiple times when clicking "=" or operator buttons. Working on fixing the logic to ensure it runs only once unless a new value is added.

Lows: Debugging this is exhausting.

Highs: The calculator actually works now!

### R1D15
Missed a commit yesterday—wedding party vibes 🎉.
Exhausted, so not much coding done, but I stayed in the learning zone:
📺 Watched WebBos videos on Emmet
📘 Read Emmet docs
📰 Browsed dev articles

### R1D16
✅ Finished my Calculator Project! It might still be a little buggy, but I’m calling it done for now — I can always come back to fine-tune it later.
🧠 Also spent time learning and practicing:

- Emmet — makes writing HTML/CSS so much faster.
- SVG — explored how scalable vector graphics work and how to use them.
Highs: Big win getting the calculator project across the finish line!
Lows: Still a few quirks in the code

### R1D17
Forgot to commit yesterday. Eyes have been feeling tired for no reason lately. 😓
Kept it light — explored HTML tables. Surprising how deep and broad the topic is!

### R1D18
Forgot to commit again yesterday—been so tired lately by evening 😴
Did an exercise on HTML tables. Learned about scope, id, headers, col, row, rowgroup, colgroup.
Also explored CSS resets: Normalize, Meyer’s Reset, and others.

### R1D19
Learned about CSS units—rem, em, px, %, ch, vw, and when to use each.
Also explored best font practices and discovered some new CSS properties.

## R1D20
learned about advanced css selector, css positioning and css functions

### R1D21
Day 21 of #100DaysOfCode
Wrapped up CSS functions and explored CSS custom properties.
Took a brief dive into CSS frameworks & preprocessors.
Also read several articles on browser compatibility, super insightful stuff

### R1D22
Focused on HTML forms today—covered various form controls like input types, labels, buttons, and more.
Understanding how to structure forms properly is 🔑 for good UX

### R1D23
Focused on form validation today using just HTML and CSS—no JavaScript yet. Explored built-in validation rules and how to style valid/invalid states. Also refreshed some basics on regex.

### R1D24
Kept it light today. Spent time researching regex in preparation for the upcoming sign-up form project with HTML & CSS validation. Felt a bit unready, but I’ve realized it's okay to start and revisit concepts as needed. 

### R1D25
Built a sign-up form using HTML pattern + regex for validation. Applied what I’ve learned so far—semantic HTML, CSS properties, and used rem over px for better UI/UX scaling.
Not pixel-perfect, but everything works smoothly!

### R1D26
Did a brief intro to CSS Grid today—learning about rows, columns, and how grid layout works. Looking forward to building more with it soon!

### R1D27
Kept it light today—just explored a bit of the history behind CSS Grid. Was interesting to see how far layout systems have come.

### R1D28
Forgot to commit yesterday—slept off 😴. Been diving into CSS Grid. Not gonna lie, the syntax is a bit confusing.
But I now understand:
🔹 grid-template basics
🔹 How to use line numbers & named areas
🔹 Overlapping grid items

### R1D29
Day 29 of #100DaysOfCode
Still working through CSS Grid. Focused on layouts today using:
🔹 grid-area
🔹 repeat(), minmax(), min(), and clamp() — super useful for flexible grid tracks
Also did a quick recap of grid concepts.

### R1D30
Wrapped up a CSS Grid recap today!
🔹 Rewatched some videos on when to use Grid vs Flexbox
🔹 Learned how to use auto-fit, auto-fill, and minmax() with repeat()
Really starting to grasp layout strategies better now.
